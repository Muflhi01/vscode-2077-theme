# 2077 Theme

![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/endormi/vscode-2077-theme.svg)

[Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/) inspired theme.

The base of the theme is copied from [outrun](https://github.com/samrap/outrun-theme-vscode).
I edited the theme quite a bit to make it more similar to the Cyberpunk 2077 color palette.

### This is only the beta release

Which means that it's not currently available in the marketplace

Clone to test this theme out:

```
git clone https://github.com/endormi/vscode-2077-theme.git
```

If any issues occur, please open up a new [issue](https://github.com/endormi/vscode-2077-theme/issues).

**Enjoy!**
